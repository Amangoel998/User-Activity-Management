# User-Activity-Management
This is an Assignment project that is built using React framwork for UI. The user interface that allows a user to view a list of users from a mock API server. On clicking on any user, a modal should open which displays all the time ranges during which they were active on that day, with an option to view all the periods of activity for different days using a calendar.
